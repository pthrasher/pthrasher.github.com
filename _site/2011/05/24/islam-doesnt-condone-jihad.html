		<p>Firstly, before we go <em>any</em> further, I&#8217;m not a follower of islam. Now that we&#8217;ve got that settled, let&#8217;s continue. The purpose for this post is to educate people. Most Americans have been force fed a lie. We have been told over and over by people we respect and appreciate, that Jihad is a core tenant of Islam. We&#8217;ve been told that regardless of what the &#8220;nice muslims&#8221; tell us, the Qur&#8217;an does in fact state that Jihad is necessary.</p>

<p>This couldn&#8217;t be further from the truth.</p>

<p>If you ask a &#8220;Jihadist&#8221; what verse in the Qur&#8217;an supports Jihad, they will tell you that verse 98:6 does. Below is that verse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Qur&#8217;an, chapter 98, verse 6:</strong> <br />Those who reject (Truth), among the People of the Book and among the Polytheists, will be in Hell-Fire, to dwell therein (for aye). They are the worst of creatures.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does that verse in any way even sound like it supports Jihad? Not to me. Yet this is the verse cited to say non-believers need to be killed. What most people don&#8217;t realize, is that &#8220;people of the book&#8221; doesn&#8217;t just mean the jews and the christians. It also means muslims. They too are people of the book.</p>

<p>You might be saying, &#8220;Well, perhaps it&#8217;s vague on purpose, but the message may still be there somehow that they should kill people of other faiths.&#8221; Take a look at the next verse I have from the Qur&#8217;an.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Quran, chapter 2, verse 62:</strong> <br />VERILY, those who have attained to faith <span>in this writ</span>, as well as those who follow the Jewish faith, and the Christians, and the Sabians – all who believe in God and the Last Day and do righteous deeds – shall have their reward with their Sustainer; and no fear need they have, and neither shall they grieve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that one pretty much explains itself.</p>

<p>Now, regardless of these two verses, it seems there are evil people in the world. Just as there are evil christians. The religion isn&#8217;t the enemy here as many would suggest. Islam is no more capable of mass harm by virtue than Christianity is. They both are just as capable as each other at having Jihad, or crusades.</p>

<p>People always say you can&#8217;t judge a religion by its followers. Well&#8230; if you can&#8217;t judge it by the followers, what can you judge it by? If a tree never bears fruit, I&#8217;m going to believe nothing good will come of that tree, and cut it down &#8211; it&#8217;s wasting space that could be filled by something better.</p>

<p>Islam is not inherently evil (aside from not being christianity) as is suggested by many. It&#8217;s the people, and no matter the religion, belief etc&#8230; Evil people are born every day. So long as we have people, we will have bad things happening to good people. It&#8217;s just the way it is.</p>

<p>Now can we stop having holy wars, hating others just for their beliefs, and just live in peace?</p>
