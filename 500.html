<h1>500 error &mdash; Oops!</h1>

This is a static site. I'm not quite sure how you managed to create a 500 error, but you did. Don't worry, I'm not monitoring the logs, and I won't do anything about it. How about just <a href="/">reading some of my posts</a> &mdash; assuming that's not what got you here in the first place ;-)
