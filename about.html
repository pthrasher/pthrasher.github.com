Hello, my name is Philip Thrasher. I'm a computer programmer living in Atlanta, GA. I do most of my coding on the internets, but I do enjoy hacking around on the desktop now and then. My strong suit is UI/UX with javascript, but I do also dabble in on some front-backend stuff in php, and python. My current favorite framework is django. Django makes building enterprisey, complex web apps as simple as building, uh, well, simple ones.
<br />
<br />
I'm well versed in many other things in my field, but rather than enumerate them here, why don't you shoot me an email at <strong>philip.thrasher (at) gmail (dot) com</strong>. I'm available for projects large and small, and I enjoy solving hard challenges.

<br />
<br />
Some companies I've worked for:
<ul>
    <li>Turner Broadcasting, Inc. (CNN)</li>
    <li>Heystac</li>
</ul>
