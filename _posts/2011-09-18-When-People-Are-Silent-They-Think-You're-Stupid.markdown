title: When People Are Silent They Think You're Stupid

When you make a comment that you think is profound, or clever, and you tweet
it, and no one responds or retweets, or when you're talking to someone, and you
say something you think shows just how advanced your perception at your young
age of the world around you is, and they're silent... They have just written
you off.

You see, the thing is, you're young. This is great. There is nothing wrong with
this. The side effect, is that while you may believe you have experienced
a whole lot, or that you've "Been through more than most", the cold, hard truth
you don't want to hear, is that you haven't.

I'm not very old, but I can tell you, as I get older, I learn more,
I experience more, but one thing is for certain. I realize every day how little
I actually do know. As I progress through life, I make "profound" statements
less and less. This is the mark of someone with experience in something.
Silence. Modesty.

You see, I always felt like, in order to impress those older than me, in order
to get them to respect me more, I'd have to trick them into liking me based on
the incredible, mature, old-soulish things I could say to them. For a very
select few people, this actually worked. The fact that it worked at all just
bolstered this idea in my head, but the truth was, those few people didn't
represent the majority of people out there.

It's also easy to surround yourself with people who will affirm that you're
special. In a truly public forum, though, you'll see quickly you're not as
special as you think. This is okay, there is nothing wrong with this. It's not
that you're not smart, or capable of profound statements, it's just that many
other people are also equally capable.

People are silent because they already know what you're saying. When people
don't know, they ask questions, unless they don't care. If they don't care,
that's their issue.

Mostly, I say all this to talk to a younger version of me, that may be out
there. If you want to seem more knowlegable, addmitting what you don't know is
the best way to go.
