I was introduced to Steve, and Apple in 2005 when I bought my
first Macintosh.
  
It was a first gen Mac Mini. -- I was immediately in love.
  
I used to make fun of the smug fanboys, who seemed like control
freaks. In fact, it always seemed a bit off putting, that all these people
wouldn't just leave me alone, and let me use my linux box in peace. They
would always be there proclaiming, and sometimes in the most tactful
ways "You need to buy a mac. That is the only good computer in
existance."
  
I distincly remember their sales pitch being "too good." -- They had
learned from the best.
  
Though, even this was off putting. It was still a
sales pitch, and so it was easy to write people off as just fanboys.
Afterall, how could just a computer actually be worth evangelizing?
  
Once I finally took the plunge, and bought my Mac, it was readily
apparent what all the fuss was about. It wasn't that people were
just rooting for an underdog. It wasn't that people were just crazy
hipsters eating the pizza before it was cool.
  
No. It was more. It was becuase Steve, and his colleages **cared** about
every last detail of anything they shipped. They **loved** the product
and wanted it to be the best computer on the planet. That love was
passed from their products onto their users. When you care about
something in this way, **it shows**
  
When you sit down in front of an Apple product, you know it was made by
someone who had you in mind when designing it. Becuase they thought
about you, you think about them. Because they cared about you, you
care about them and the things they make. This is why Apple enjoys a
cult following.
  
They didn't build a business that sold things people wanted. They built
great stuff that people couldn't ignore. The successful business was a
side effect.
  
Steve always wanted to make great products. I don't think anyone will
disagree that he accomplished that many times over. Steve would say
the products themselves weren't revolutionary, and I tend to agree. It
goes beyond the products. It's the thinking, the caring, and the passion that
went into them. That's what's revolutionary.
  
For anyone who may wonder what was so special... How he could have
touched anyone's life, I think it can be explained simply by saying he
was profoundly successful. I think I like Emerson's definition of
success the most.
..
>to laugh often and much, to win respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;
>to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends;
>to appreciate beauty; to find the best in others;
>to leave the world a bit better whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition;
>**to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.** This is to have succeeded.
> -- Emerson
  
Steve imprinted himself into everything he did. He contantly pushed
himself, and anyone around him to do better and better and better.
People were cool with this becuase he held himself to the same
standard. He was a mentor to us all.
  
  
  
  
Steve, thanks for everything man.
