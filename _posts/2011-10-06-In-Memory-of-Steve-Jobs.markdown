I was first introduced to Steve, and Apple in 2005 when I bought my
first Macintosh. It was a first gen Mac Mini. I was immediately in
love. I used to make fun of the smug fanboys, who seemed like control
freaks saying "You have to look at my mac! You will love it! It is
better than anything else. IF YOU DON'T LOVE IT THERE IS SOMETHING
WRONG WITH YOU."
  
It just always seemed odd to me, but after buying one I realized what
it was that drove people to this madness. It wasn't that people were
just rooting for an underdog. It wasn't that people were just crazy
hipsters.
  
No. It was more. It was becuase Steve, and his colleages *cared* about
every last detail of anything they shipped. The *loved* the product
and wanted it to be the best computer on the planet. That love was
passed from their products onto their users. Anyone who has used an
Apple product has felt this.
  
When you sit down in front of an Apple product, you know it was made by
someone who had you in mind when designing it. Becuase they thought
about you, you think about them. Because they cared about you, you
cared about them. This is why Apple enjoys a cult following.
  
They didn't build a business that sold things people wanted. They built
great stuff that people couldn't ignore. The successful business was a
side effect.
  
Steve always wanted to make great products. I don't think anyone will
doubt that he accomplished that many times over. Steve would say
the products themselves weren't revolutionary. I tend to agree. It
goes beyond the products. The thinking, the caring, the passion that
went into them. That's what's revolutionary.
  
Steve imprinted himself into everything he did. He contantly pushed
himself, and anyone around him to do better and better and better.
People were cool with this becuase he held himself to the same
standard. He was a mentor to us all.
  
Steve, thanks for everything man.
