Fresh Start
-----------

As many of you might have noticed, I redesigned my blog. I was tired of what
I had, and wanted a solid change. Furthermore, I wanted it to be pretty much
about the content, and only the content. This is, in the end, all that really
matters, right? (hint: just say yes, my little minion) So, for this redesign,
I decided that I needed to focus on good typography and letter spacing, high
contrast reading and easy navigation. I picked out some cool google web fonts,
played with shades of grey for a couple of days and finally came to what you
see here. 
  
I Can Haz Google Fonts?
-----------------------

As a matter of fact, no... You cannot haz. At least, not on any ClearType
enabled system. After showing off my blog to a couple of windows brethren, they
informed me that my website looked like a bucket of ass on windows. This was
due to the lovely font rendering system that windows uses. The crazy thing is,
it wasn't that windows didn't attempt to display the font. It was that the font
just looked like complete trash, riddled with artifacts, at *any* size!
  
This was infuriating. I really spent quite a bit of time picking out great
looking, easy-to-read fonts, only to have them shat on by Windows. Even still,
I found this very odd. I just couldn't believe windows could choke this bad on
something as simple as rendering a font that was saved in a standard format. In
my mind, there _must_ have been something I was doing wrong.
  
You're an Idiot, and Microsoft Hates You
----------------------------------------

If you view my site in linux -an open source operating system- you will see
beautiful google fonts api typography. If you view it on a mac, you will see
the same. Switch to windows, and it becomes apparent that Microsoft likes it
when their customer's eyes bleed uncontrollably, causing the zombie apocalypse
to seem like it's coming earlier than expected. Instead of babbling on, allow
me to show you some imagery. Below you'll see the fine redering that Mac OS
X (my primary dev machine) does.

And, as for the incredible windows:

One important thing to note here, is that both of these were in google chrome.
I didn't test the rendering of Safari on Windows, but I can only imagine it
would have been just fine.
  
Why Hast Thou Betrayed Me, My Precious Chrome?
---------------------------------------------

The one thing I'm wondering here, though... Is that if google is offering these
web fonts, they have their own browser capable of rendering said fonts, and it
is well known that ClearType is as shitty as a cow patty, *then why the hell
are my fonts ugly in Chrome?*
  
This seems to be an oversight, in my opinion, on the part of Google. Perhaps it
will be fixed in a later version (hopefully soon), who knows. It's broken for
now, and it seems we'll have to continue to wait for good, cross-platform, web
typography.
