/ Any coward can sit in his home and      \
| criticize a pilot for flying into a     |
| mountain in a fog. But I would rather,  |
| by far, die on a mountainside than in   |
| bed. What kind of man would live where  |
| there is no daring? And is life so dear |
| that we should blame men for dying in   |
| adventure? Is there a better way to     |
| die?                                    |
